# NAND2Tetris – Elements of Computing 

This repository contains my project work for the NAND2Tetris course, completed as part of the Elements of Computing curriculum in my B.Tech program. The course focuses on building a complete computer system from first principles, starting from logic gates and progressing to a functioning CPU architecture. This repository currently includes completed implementations for Projects 1, 2, 3, and 5 of the official NAND2Tetris project sequence.

## Completed Projects

Project 1 – Logic Gates  
Implementation of basic and composite logic gates using only NAND gates in HDL.

Project 2 – Arithmetic Logic  
Construction of arithmetic circuits including adders and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

Project 3 – Sequential Logic  
Design of flip-flops, registers, and memory units (RAM).

Project 5 – Computer Architecture  
Complete implementation of the Hack CPU and memory system.

Each project folder contains HDL source files and test scripts for validation using the official NAND2Tetris simulators.

## Repository Structure

/project1 → Logic gate implementations

## Course Context

This work was completed as part of the Elements of Computing semester course. The objective of the course is to understand computer systems from the ground up, bridging digital logic, computer architecture, and low-level system design through hands-on implementation.

## Key Concepts Covered

Hardware Description Language (HDL)  
Digital logic and gate-level design  
Arithmetic and sequential circuits  
Memory organization  
CPU architecture (Hack Computer)
