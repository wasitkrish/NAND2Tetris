## 💻 NAND2Tetris – Elements of Computing

This repository contains my project work for the **NAND2Tetris: Elements of Computing Systems** course, completed as part of the **Elements of Computing** curriculum in my B.Tech program.

NAND2Tetris is a bottom-up exploration of computer systems — constructing an entire computer **from NAND gates to a working CPU**, purely from first principles. This repository documents my implementations across multiple stages of that journey.

🚀 **Completed Projects:** 1, 2, 3, and 5 from the official NAND2Tetris project sequence.

## 📌 Completed Projects

**Project 1 – Logic Gates**  
Implementation of fundamental and composite logic gates using only NAND gates in HDL.

**Project 2 – Arithmetic Logic**  
Construction of arithmetic circuits including adders and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

**Project 3 – Sequential Logic**  
Design of flip-flops, registers, and RAM modules.

**Project 5 – Computer Architecture**  
Complete implementation of the Hack CPU and memory system.

Each project folder contains HDL source files and official test scripts for verification using NAND2Tetris simulators.

## 🎓 Course Context

This work was completed as part of the **Elements of Computing** semester course.

The course develops a deep understanding of computer systems by connecting:

- Digital logic design  
- Computer architecture  
- Memory organization  
- Low-level system implementation  

The emphasis is on **learning by building**, not theory alone.

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Hardware Description Language (HDL)  
- Digital logic and gate-level design  
- Arithmetic and sequential circuits  
- Memory organization  
- CPU architecture (Hack Computer)
